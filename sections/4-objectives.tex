\label{sec:objectives}

Nowadays new cities are being built  completely from scratch. An example of these cities is the city of Maasdar\footnote{\url{http://www.masdar.ae/en/masdar/detail/masdar-city-free-zone}} in Abu Dhabi. This city, designed by Foster and Partners, is currently being built in the desert at an estimated cost between 18 and 19 billion US\$. Whoever is responsible for a project of this size can not afford to make any mistakes.
To designs this projects it is necessary to create models, but in contrast to the relatively small size of a model of a single building, in this situations an entire city has to be modeled. Therefore, it requires generation and visualization of very large amounts of geometry.

The overall goal of our work is to build a GD tool that solves the performance problems that raise with the generation and visualization of large amounts of geometry. It should be an easy to use tool, with very high performance that will be focused on model visualization, avoiding features regarding interactive model manipulation.

It also should be able to support Immediate Feedback, i.e. allow the users to quickly see the results of the changes they make, for much larger models than the current GD tools can handle. This system should also provide a significant amount of geometric primitives such as \emph{boxes}, \emph{cylinders} or \emph{spheres} that will allow users to model a large variety of shapes.

It will also provide a programming interface, that is how users will interact with the system. It should be simple and easy understand, yet broad and powerful to give the users freedom to create. This will be the visible part of the system together with the visualization window.

After, there is the \textbf{GPU communication} module that implement the functions provided. This module will generate the geometry description, create the windows and transfer the data to the GPU. This module will implement a set of techniques that will 

The \textbf{GPU pipeline} is where the geometry will be generated and is explained in Section~\ref{sub:modern_opengl}.


This work is being developed in the context of the Rosetta that is also a GD tool that helps architects and designers to develop their work procedurally. Rosetta is an extensible IDE based on \textbf{DrRacket} and built in Racket. 

In this context the module will act as a fast preview mode that allows the users to rapidly see the changes they make on their model during their creative process.

On the next section will be explained the architecture of our proposed solution.
