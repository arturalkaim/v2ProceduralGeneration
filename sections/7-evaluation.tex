\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This work will be evaluated in two distinct concerns: \emph{performance} and \emph{usability}.

Performance is the main concern throughout all this work so this point will be evaluated through benchmarks and comparing the time that this system takes to generate and render a set of examples to the normal pipeline.

As this work will have to provide an API, it is important to know if it is easy to use and have the needed functionality for the users to produce their models.

To evaluate this system will be implemented an interface in Racket to be tested in the context of Rosetta. Rosetta is a GD tool that is largely used by a community of architects that use it to create large models. They have a large amount of examples to be run for comparison. 



%Explain how you are going to show your results (statistical data, cpu performance etc). Answer the following questions:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Why is this solution going to be better than others.
%  \item How am I going to defend that it is better.
%\end{itemize}
