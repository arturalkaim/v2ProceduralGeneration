\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

As an active research field inside Computer Science, there is a lot of work being done in this area. In this section I give an overview of the related work that has been carried out on procedural generation of large amounts of geometry. Since the target audience of this work are architects and designers, most of the work that I present have the same target.

The main goal of this systems is to generate models that represent entire cities, that are large by definition. With this, they face some of the same problems I face so it is important to learn about their solutions.

%The related work section will highly volatile, and will mostly depend on your kind of thesis. Talk with your supervisor in order to know how to write this part. Don't take the following bullet points as a certain truth.
