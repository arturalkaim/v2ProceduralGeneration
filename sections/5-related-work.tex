\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

As an active research field inside Computer Science, there is a lot of work being done in this area. In this section I give an overview of the related work that has been carried out on procedural generation of large amounts of geometry. Since the target audience of this work are architects and designers, most of the work that I present have the same target.

The main goal of this systems is to generate models that represent entire cities, that are large by definition. With this, they face some of the same problems I face so it is important to learn about their solutions.

%The related work section will highly volatile, and will mostly depend on your kind of thesis. Talk with your supervisor in order to know how to write this part. Don't take the following bullet points as a certain truth.

\subsection{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sub:conclusion}

This works present ways to generate and visualize large amounts of geometry, in this cases applied to urban models. While the first \cite{Parish2001} aims to allow the users to create large and realistic urban models, where they give, in the limit, total control to the users, the second one\cite{Greuter2003} is much more a visualization tool, it generates the model automatically for the user to explore. Since this models
