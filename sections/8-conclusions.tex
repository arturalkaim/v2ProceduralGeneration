\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

There is a need for this work because it as shown it tackles an important problem that architects and designers face and will face even more in the future. This system must have a good performance and suport the most used functions that the users need.

My solution shortcuts the Rosetta tradicional pipeline to improve performance, doing that by using Rosetta just as an iterface and transfering as most of the processment as possible to the GPU.

One prototipe is implemented that already creates boxes and cylinders without transformations that allowes the creation of the city example in Figure~\ref{fig:pic1}.

In the future, I will explore how to implement the rest of the primitives without losses in performace and how to introduce rotation to the objects without adding much data to the current primitive description set.
