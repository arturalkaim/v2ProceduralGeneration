\subsection{Procedural Modeling} % (fold)
\label{sub:procedural_modeling}

\emph{Procedural Modeling} is the algorithmic generation of content instead of the usual manual creation of content. This can be applied in almost all forms of content, but is mostly used in the generation of graphic content, such as, textures, geometry and animations, in which is included generative design. Procedural generation is also used for the generation of sound, with procedurally generated music and synthetic speech.

The key property of procedural generation is that it describes the data entity, such texture, geometry, or sound, in terms of a sequence of instructions rather than as a static block of data \cite{Kelly}. This allows the production of big volumes of detailed, high quality, graphic content without the costs, both in time and money, of manual content creation.
