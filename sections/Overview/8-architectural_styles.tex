\subsection{Architectural Styles} % (fold)
\label{sub:architectural_styles}

Most buildings or other man made structures are classified by it's \emph{Architectural Style}. An architectural style is characterized by the features that make a building notable and historically identifiable. This style features are related to form, building materials, construction methods, etc. and change trough different places and over the years. 

Even with this constant change in the styles there are some rules that we have to followed. The most obvious one is the chronological time.
If we are modelling a city from the 16th century it's wrong if we add buildings with styles form the 19th century. And we have to think also in a simmilar way with the places, if it's an asian city we do not add buildings with a known european layout.

And this correctness in relation to the architectural styles is also an important concern to this work.
