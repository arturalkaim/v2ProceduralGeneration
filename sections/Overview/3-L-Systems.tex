\label{ssub:l_systems}

Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) are a class of string rewriting mechanisms, originally developed by Lindenmayer as a mathematical theory for plant
development. It is capable of describe the behavior of plant cells and model the growth processes of plant development.

An L-Systems consists of two different parts, one axiom and a set of production rules. The axiom is the starting point of the system, acting as a seed. Then it is applied in this seed the set of production rules, that change the initial string, producing other strings.
This is an iterative process, so after the production of a larger set of strings, the rules can be applied to each one of them which grows the size of
the set even more.

L-Systems are used to model the natural growth of vegetation (Figure~\ref{fig:trees}), and the generation of Fractals.

In this process, each symbol is associated with a production rule. For instance having $\{F, +, -\}$ for the alphabet and \emph{production} $\{F \rightarrow
 F+F--F+F\}$. From a starting axiom \emph{aba}, and the application of the rules we have:\\
\begin{equation} \label{eq:seed}
F\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:step1}
F+F--F+F\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:step2}
F+F--F+F \; + \; F+F--F+F \;- \;- \;F+F--F+F \;+ \;F+F--F+F\\
\end{equation}

%\begin{align}
%\begin{split}
%F\\
%F+F--F+F\\
%F+F--F+F \; + \; F+F--F+F \;- \;- \;F+F--F+F \;+ \;F+F--F+F\\
%\end{split}
%\end{align}
%\\

This is an example of the evolution of one system where the production is applied  in (\ref{eq:seed}) that turns into $F+F--F+F$. Note that the space
between the symbols are just for readability.

All the symbols are assigned with a geometric meaning. The notion of a turtle with a pen, as proposed in \cite{abelson1982aa}, with the symbols being
interpreted as moving instructions to the turtle, is a simple way to understand, where ``F'' means forward and the symbols ``+'' and ``-'' are interpreted as rotations counter-clockwise and clockwise respectively by a predefined angle. By applying this method to the last example and setting the angle for the rotation to $60^{\circ}$ the result is Figure~\ref{fig:kockLS}.
