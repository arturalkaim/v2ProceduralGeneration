\subsubsection{Fractals} % (fold)
\label{ssub:fractals}


A fractal is defined in \cite{Ebert2002} as ``a geometrically complex object, the complexity of which arises through the repetition of a given form over a range of scales''.
This concept is observed in some forms that exist in nature. Trees, mountains, coastlines and the network of neurons on a human cortex can be seen as examples of fractals. Natural shapes tend to be irregular and fragmented and exhibit a complexity incomparable to regular geometry \cite{mandelbrot1984fractal}.
Fractals were proposed to be seen as a new form of symmetry \cite{Ebert2002}, \emph{Dilation Symmetry}, which is when an object is invariant over a change of scale. This invariance might be only qualitatively and not exact. For instance, a river network exhibit dilation symmetry if \textit{zooming in} in some part looks the same as the whole image. As this example, many others show dilated symmetry such as clouds, tree branches and some vegetables as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NFractals}.

This idea was applied in maths and resulted in a new area in this science called fractal mathematics. The objective of this field is to describe very complex shapes with simple rules such as repeating a substitution pattern.

In Figure~\ref{fig:GFractals} there are four examples of Geometric Fractals, with the first five iterations of each one. All of them are built by the substitution of a part of the image by another one. 

The example of the second row is known as the Koch snowflake. In this example, at each iteration, all the line segments are replaced by four segments with 1/3 of the size of the original one with the two in the middle being placed in a angle forming a equilateral triangle with the original line that is removed.

It is clear that the detail that is presented in each iteration increases as the scale changes. There is the concept of \emph{Fractal Dimension} that tries to measure this evolution, in which the detail in a pattern changes in comparison with the scale in which it is measured.

As stated before, the world is visually very complex, so when synthesizing worlds, ``\emph{complexity} equals \emph{work}''\cite{Ebert2002}. This work can be done by the programmer/artist or by a computer. Fractals as being defined as a simple mathematical function, it is relatively easy to implement a procedure that model one fractal. 

This technique is used to model many natural forms that present fractal properties. Mountains, for instance, are usually modeled using of fractals. Other natural forms that present fractal properties are trees, river systems, lightning or vascular systems in living beings.
