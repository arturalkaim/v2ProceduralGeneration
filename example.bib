“Community networking”, also known as “bottom-up networking”, is an emerging model for the Future Internet, where communities of citizens build, operate and own open IP-based networks

In Southern Europe, Guifi.net [2] in Spain is a very large network consisting of more than 20,000 nodes andmore than 24,000 links. For

COMMUNITY-LAB To allow more research with community networks, theCommunity-Lab [15] testbed is being developed and oper- ated by the European FP7 CONFINE project (Commu- nity Networks Testbed for the Future Internet, FP7 In- tegrated Project 2011-2015) [16], federating existing com- munity networks. The goal of the testbed is supporting experimentally-driven research on community-owned open local IP networks. To achieve this goal, the CONFINE testbed integrates with and extends three existing commu- nity},

abstract = {Cities are the largest human artifacts and appear often in digital entertainment. Building digital models of them is extremely difficult, yet there are few tools that can assist artists in this task. We describe a method for procedurally generating city models using agent- based modeling, an established simulation technique in the social, biological, and physical sciences. Our system accepts a terrain description as input and produces a land usage map that portrays roads and residential, commercial, and industrial land use. The results con- form well to modern patterns of land use, but each generated city is unique. Our system is controlled by a set of parameters that users can alter numerically or gesturally in order to constrain and guide the results to fit a particular application’s needs.},

Readers will progress from building a basic physics engine to creating intelligent moving objects and complex systems, setting the foundation for further experiments in generative design. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. The book's examples are written in Processing, an open-source language and development environment built on top of the Java programming language. On the book's website (http: //www.natureofcode.com), the examples run in the browser via Processing's JavaScript mode.},

@book{Ebert2002,
abstract = {The third edition of this classic tutorial and reference on procedural texturing and modeling is thoroughly updated to meet the needs of today's 3D graphics professionals and students. New for this edition are chapters devoted to real-time issues, cellular texturing, geometric instancing, hardware acceleration, futuristic environments, and virtual universes. In addition, the familiar authoritative chapters on which readers have come to rely contain all-new material covering L-systems, particle systems, scene graphs, spot geometry, bump mapping, cloud modeling, and noise improvements. There are many new spectacular color images to enjoy, especially in this edition's full-color format. As in the previous editions, the authors, who are the creators of the methods they discuss, provide extensive, practical explanations of widely accepted techniques as well as insights into designing new ones. New to the third edition are chapters by two well-known contributors: Bill Mark of NVIDIA and John Hart of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on state-of-the-art topics not covered in former editions. An accompanying Web site (www.texturingandmodeling.com) contains all of the book's sample code in C code segments (all updated to the ANSI C Standard) or in RenderMan shading language, plus files of many magnificent full-color illustrations. No other book on the market contains the breadth of theoretical and practical information necessary for applying procedural methods. More than ever, Texturing \& Modeling remains the chosen resource for professionals and advanced students in computer graphics and animation. *New chapters on: procedural real-time shading by Bill Mark, procedural geometric instancing and real-time solid texturing by John Hart, hardware acceleration strategies by David Ebert, cellular texturing by Steven Worley, and procedural planets and virtual universes by Ken Musgrave. *New material on Perlin Noise by Ken Perlin. *Printed in full color throughout. *Companion Web site contains revised sample code and dozens of images.},

@book{Cohen2003,
abstract = {We present a simple stochastic system for non-periodically tiling the plane with a small set of Wang Tiles. The tiles may be filled with texture, patterns, or geometry that when assembled create a continuous representation. The primary advantage of using Wang Tiles is that once the tiles are filled, large expanses of non-periodic texture (or patterns or geometry) can be created as needed very efficiently at runtime. Wang Tiles are squares in which each edge is assigned a color. A valid tiling requires all shared edges between tiles to have matching colors. We present a new stochastic algorithm to nonperiodically tile the plane with a small set of Wang Tiles at runtime. Furthermore, we present new methods to fill the tiles with 2D texture, 2D Poisson distributions, or 3D geometry to efficiently create at runtime as much non-periodic texture (or distributions, or geometry) as needed. We leverage previous texture synthesis work and adapt it to fill Wang Tiles. We demonstrate how to fill individual tiles with Poisson distributions that maintain their statistical properties when combined. These are used to generate a large arrangement of plants or other objects on a terrain. We show how such environments can be rendered efficiently by pre-lighting the individual Wang Tiles containing the geometry. We also extend the definition of Wang Tiles to include a coding of the tile corners to allow discrete objects to overlap more than one edge. The larger set of tiles provides increased degrees of freedom.},
